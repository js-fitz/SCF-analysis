# Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) Racial Wealth Gap Analysis

### Contains code to download triennial SCF data from 1989-2019 & assess racial wealth gap over time

#### Source details: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm

Code adapted from Dan Valanzuela in `scf_collector.py`. Racial wealth gap analysis & plotting in `wealth_stats_overtime.py`. Use `Examples.py` to replicate these results and for conducting further analysis.

Vehicle values are subtracted from household net wealth to reduce skew from consumer durables in cross-demographic analyses. For racial wealth gap analysis, all five implicates for each housold are weighted with a factor of 1/5.

To load a Pandas dataframe or CSV for a given year, use `wealth_stats_overtime.load_df(year, filetype)`
